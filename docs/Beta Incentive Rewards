![IncentiveRewards](/img/IncentiveRewards.png)

## **Earn Rewards For Each Trade**

We are excited to announce that our Incentivized Beta is now active. Throughout the beta period, we have allocated a portion of the treasury‚Äôs tokens to participants in our beta incentive to earn CRASH tokens. 
With the beta now launched on the main-net from (block #: 10559000 | block slot: 129134396) , users trading on Crashr will earn CRASH for participating at a variable rate based on the number of transactions on the platform with additional bonuses based on the duration of the trades taking place.

## Rewards During the Beta

For the entirety of the beta, we will allocate 1 million CRASH tokens, which is 1% of the tokens from the treasury released at TGE, to our beta incentive participants. The rewards will be distributed upon the conclusion of the beta.
Each action, including creating listings, completing listings, and sending offers, will earn participants a baseline of 100 CRASH tokens.

## Rewards Details

- Creating Listings: Users will earn rewards for each trade they create.
- Completing Listings: Users who complete a trade by matching the requested assets will earn rewards.
- Offers: Users who send offers to existing listings or accept offers will also earn rewards.

## Rewards Formula

For simplicity, you can calculate your potential earnings using the formula below:

Where:
ùê¥ = The total number of actions (Creating, Completing, and Offers)

## Multipliers for Increased Activity

We will provide users with a daily multiplier of 0.5x for every 24 hours they trade on Crashr. This multiplier is capped at 3.5x, which is 7 days, converting to a 0.05x multiplier per additional day onwards. At the end of the beta period, qualified users will receive an airdrop.

### Scenario Example:

If you have:

- 20 Created Listings
- 15 Completed Listings
- 10 Sent Offers

If you traded once daily for 7 days straight (0.5 x 7 = 3.5x) , you will earn:

Where:
ùê¥ = The total number of actions (listings, offers, and trades)
Bm = The total bonus multipliers

Additionally, in the example, you will gain an extra 0.05x daily on top of the 13,500 CRASH each consecutive week to hold, equating to 675 CRASH a week for the scenario example.

## Bonus for Bombers Holders
All Bombers holders will receive an additional 0.01x multiplier for each Bomber they hold at the end of the beta additional to the total bonus multipliers.

## Bonus for Partners
Trade any assets from our partners (e.g., Fren, Nike) by creating and completing trades involving these assets to receive an additional 0.05x multiplier towards the total bonus multipliers accrued for those trades.

## Beta Manipulation Prevention
The team at Crashr reserves the right to analyze and blacklist any addresses during the beta that appear to use bots or manipulate rewards. If we determine that an address is manipulating the system, it will be disqualified from receiving any rewards. The beta rewards incentive aims to provide a fair system for all users, and we have measures in place to detect any suspicious actions on the platform. If you detect any manipulation for an address, please use this form to report users.

## Final Remarks
To ensure fair beta incentive rewards, we expect healthy user trading and fair use of the rewards incentive. Once the leaderboard is implemented, you will be able to track user activity by the number of trades created and their frequency. We will announce the conclusion of the beta on our socials. The beta will conclude upon the completion of bug fixes and improvements, leading to a better user experience for traders. We will announce an end date (cardano epoch/time) later on that will officially mark the end of beta. For any feedback or concerns, please reach out to us on Discord. We aim to improve the platform and make the official launch of Crashr a success, striving to be the top of Cardano‚Äôs asset trading.

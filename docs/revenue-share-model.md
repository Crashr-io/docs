# Revenue Share Model

![Revenue Share Pie-Chart](/img/chart.png)

## Revenue Share Model

To incentivize user engagement and trading activity, our platform implements a streamlined revenue-sharing model, distributing generated income across three fundamental components of the protocol. The treasury, staking, and buyback. &#x20;

### Treasury

The treasury supports the platform's development, maintenance, and expansion. It's also staked to the Crashr Stake Pool to aid in decentralization and enhance the network. To maintain heightened security and trust, the treasury's funds are secured in a multi-signature wallet.

**Allocation**: **60%** of all collected fees.

### Staking

Staking rewards play a crucial role in promoting both short and long-term engagement for users who hold our protocol token $CRASH. By participating in staking, users not only earn rewards but also support the token economy and align with the long-term vision of the platform. Upon the release of the staking program, rewards will be determined based on the [amount and duration](docs/tokenomics/usdcrash-staking.md) of $CRASH tokens staked. These rewards will be distributed in the form of ADA, providing users with greater accessibility and choice. With ADA rewards, users have the flexibility to exchange ADA for more $CRASH tokens or trade for other assets.

**Allocation**: **20%** of all collected fees.

### Rewards Pool

The rewards pool, also can be remembered as the "Pool of ADA," is designed to reward users who trade on Crashr. This initiative aims to boost trading volume and activity. The rewards pool is distributed to users who create and complete trades, incentivizing trading. Initially, the rewards pool will be funded by the treasury. Further details will be explained in mid-Q3 on the [Protocol Incentive](docs/Protocol_Incentive.md) page.

**Allocation**: **20%** of all collected fees.

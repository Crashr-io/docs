# Revenue Share Model

![Revenue Share Pie-Chart](/img/chart.png)

## Revenue Share Model

Our platform implements a streamlined revenue-sharing model to incentivize user engagement and promote trading activity. This revenue split will consist of the three categories below.

### Treasury

The treasury supports the platform's development, maintenance, and expansion. When funds are not in use, the collected fees are staked to the Crashr Stake Pool. The treasury's funds are secured in a multi-signature wallet to maintain security and trust.

**Allocation**: **60%** of all collected fees.

### Staking

Our staking benefit is in place for long-term $CRASH token holders. By participating in staking, users earn rewards while supporting the token economy and the platform's long-term vision.
Upon the release of the staking program, rewards will be determined based on the amount and duration of $CRASH tokens staked. 

These rewards will be distributed in the form of ADA, allowing users to hold ADA and diversify their portfolio to their liking. In this way, users can exchange ADA for more $CRASH tokens or trade for other assets on the platform.
(Mechanics coming soon)

**Allocation**: **20%** of all collected fees.

### Rewards Pool

Our rewards pool will consist of ADA and is strictly in place to reward users who utilize our platform and execute trades. **This is entirely separate from the staking pool.

All transactions within the beta are being recorded in our internal leaderboard for the beta period. As you engage in trades, we calculate the sum of all transactions and distribute the respective ADA rewards to the user. (Mechanics coming soon)

Further details will be released in mid-Q3, with in-depth information on the [trading rewards](docs/Trading%20Rewards.md) page.

**Allocation**: **20%** of all collected fees.

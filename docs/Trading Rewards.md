# Trading Rewards

## **Prerequisite**

Trading rewards are incentives that users receive when they create or complete a trade on our platform. To earn these rewards, the volume of the trade and the time frame during which the trade took place are recorded. Further details on the specific mechanics of these rewards will be released soon. All transactions that occur from the time the mainnet was launched are recorded, and users will be rewarded accordingly.

## Rewards System Dynamics

**Coming this Q3!** Start trading and see your transactions displayed on the leaderboard upon release. Earn rewards for your activity and compete with others.

## Trading Rewards Benefits

* **Mitigating Volatility:** By utilizing ADA and other tokens collected from our platform fees as reward currencies, we can prevent potential inflation of our protocol token, $CRASH. table investment environment.

* **Flexible Rewards:** Users accumulate ADA through their activity on Crashr, which can be converted into $CRASH tokens at the user's discretion. This approach provides flexibility for users, giving them the opportunity to engage with the rewards in a manner that best suits their needs without directly impacting the circulating supply of $CRASH. 

* **Increased Liquidity:** Using ADA and other tokens for rewards helps increase the liquidity of $CRASH. Since rewards are not distributed directly in $CRASH, the supply remains controlled, leading to more stable trading volumes and a healthier market. 

* **Diversified Reward System:** By offering rewards in ADA and other tokens, we provide a diversified reward system that can attract a broader range of users. This diversification includes well-known cryptocurrencies and potentially other tokens such as $SNEK, $NIKE, or $CLAY. 

## Previously Collected Points v1.0

With v1.0 of Crashr, the use of points were awarded to users for staking our NFT collection and to early testers of Crashr v1.0. Upon the Token Generation Event (TGE) and its distribution schedule, these users will receive an airdrop of $CRASH Tokens, determined by the number of points they have at that given time (till TGE). With the introduction of the new points dynamic, staking will be phased out, making trading activity and staking along with $CRASH on our staking page the sole way to earn rewards on our platform. 

## Conclusion

Our protocol incentive with the trading rewards system is our commitement to creating a sustainable, user-centric trading platform. By innovating, we offer a balanced approach that rewards users while maintaining the integrity and value of the ecosystem.&#x20;

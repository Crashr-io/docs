# Protocol Incentive

## **Rewards**

The protocol rewards are incentivized through a "points system" in which points are awarded to both the buyer and seller of a transaction, equivalent in value to the ADA involved. For example: If your transaction is worth 100 ADA, you and the other party receive 100 Points that are linked to the stake address.

## Rewards System Dynamics

Instead of directly awarding $CRASH tokens for every transaction, Crashr introduces a points system in order to incentive trading activity. This approach with the points system is maintained through our offchain infrastructure and developed to prevent the rapid dispersion of tokens. Each quarter, the points will be converted into $CRASH tokens which are rewarded from the protocol rewards token allocation.&#x20;

Ecosystem benefits:

* **Mitigating Volatility:** By awarding points for transactions instead of tokens, we minimize the risk of token over saturation. 
* **Flexible Rewards:** Users accumulate points through their activity on Crashr which are than converted to $CRASH tokens.

## Current Points v1.0

With v1.0 of Crashr, points were awarded to users for staking our NFT collection and to early testers of Crashr v1.0. Upon the Token Generation Event (TGE), these users will receive an airdrop of $CRASH Tokens, determined by the number of points they have at that given time. With the introduction of the new points dynamic, staking will be phased out, making trading activity the sole way to earn points on our platform. Until this new system is in place, users can gain points by both staking and trading on v1.0.

## Conclusion

Our protocol incetive with the points system is our commitement to creating a sustainable, user-centric trading platform. By innovating beyond traditional token rewards, we offer a balanced approach that rewards users while maintaining the integrity and value of the ecosystem.&#x20;

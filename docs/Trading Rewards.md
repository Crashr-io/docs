# Trading Rewards

![Trading Rewards](/img/TradingRewards.png)

## **Summary**

Trading rewards are given to users as incentives for creating or completing trades on our platform. These rewards are earned based on the trade volume and time frame in which the trade occurred and are tracked on our internal leaderboard. More details about the specific mechanics of these rewards will be provided in the near future. Since the mainnet beta launch, all transactions have been recorded, and users will continue to receive rewards based on their activity.

## Rewards System Dynamics

**Coming this Q3!** Trade, view your transactions on the leaderboard and compete with other users to earn rewards. Leaderboard feature will be added in upcoming updates.

## Trading Rewards Benefits

* **Reduced Sell Pressure:** By utilizing ADA and other tokens collected from our platform fees as reward currencies, we can mitigate the potential of users converting, or selling off their rewards once received. This gives the users the choice of what they want to do with their earned rewards.

* **Flexibility:** As users accumulate ADA through their activity on Crashr, they have the option to buy an additional $CRASH and stake it to increase their rewards. This provides everyone with a better opportunity to earn and manage their portfolio according to their individual needs, without creating significant fluctuations in the circulating supply of $CRASH.

* **Increased Liquidity:** Using ADA and other tokens for rewards helps increase the liquidity of $CRASH. Since rewards are not distributed directly in $CRASH, the supply remains controlled, leading to less volatility, and a healthier uptrend for the token. 

* **Diversified Reward System:** By offering rewards in ADA and other tokens, we provide a diversified reward system that can attract a broader range of users. This diversification includes well-known cryptocurrencies and potentially other tokens such as $SNEK, $NIKE, or $CLAY. Shining light on all the great Cardano native tokens that users are eyeing. 

## Previously Collected Points v1.0

With v1.0 of Crashr, the use of points was awarded to users for staking our NFT collection and to early testers of Crashr v1.0. Upon the Token Generation Event (TGE) and its distribution schedule, these users will receive an airdrop of $CRASH Tokens, determined by the number of points they have at that given time (till TGE). With the introduction of the new points dynamic, staking will be phased out, making trading activity and staking along with $CRASH on our staking page the sole way to earn rewards on our platform.

## Conclusion

Our protocol incentive with the trading rewards system is our commitement to creating a sustainable, user-centric trading platform. By innovating, we offer a balanced approach that rewards users while maintaining the integrity and value of the ecosystem.&#x20;

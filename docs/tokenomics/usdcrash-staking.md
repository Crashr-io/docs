# $CRASH Staking

## Staking Information

For individuals participating in the $CRASH ecosystem aiming to earn a portion of the revenue generated from the platform's trading activities, staking their $CRASH tokens is essential. The share of revenue each participant receives is influenced by three key factors: \
\
1\) The duration the $CRASH tokens staked, \
2\) The total amount of $CRASH staked \
3\) The chosen APR (Annual Percentage Rate).&#x20;

The distribution of revenue shares employs the total fees collected from platform operations as the foundation for calculations, ensuring that the interests of token holders are aligned with the platform's overall success and operational level, as the potential rewards for $CRASH token "stakers" increase in tandem with the trading volume and platform engagement.

Furthermore, possessing an NFT within the Crashr ecosystem serves as an APR boost, enhancing the returns from staking.&#x20;

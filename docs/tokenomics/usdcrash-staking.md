# $CRASH Staking

## Staking Information

For individuals participating in our $CRASH token ecosystem, holding the token allows you to earn a portion of the revenue generated from the platform's trading fees. Staking your $CRASH tokens is essential to earning these rewards. The share of revenue each participant receives is influenced by three key factors:

1. The duration the $CRASH tokens are staked.
2. The total amount of $CRASH staked.
3. The chosen APR (Annual Percentage Rate).

The distribution of revenue shares uses the total fees collected from platform operations as the foundation for calculations. This ensures that the interests of token holders are aligned with the platform's overall success and operational level. As trading volume and platform engagement increase, the potential rewards for $CRASH token "stakers" also rise.

Additionally, possessing an NFT within the Crashr ecosystem will serve as an APR boost, enhancing the returns from staking.

More information on APR percentages will be released closer to the development of the staking mechanics, which will be after the TGE.

# Distribution & Vesting

## Prerequisite 

Our goal is to create an inclusive and decentralized token that reflects our commitment to broad-based participation. To do so, we have allocated a significant portion of the tokens to the public sale. This allows diverse participants to contribute to the token without the risk of high volatility due to the increased supply, regardless of market demand. Ultimately, our tokenomics strategy promotes a balanced and fair token launch, benefiting all participants. 

## Official Token Distribution & Vesting 

The total supply of the protocol token $CRASH is 100,000,000. To ensure transparency with our tokenomics, we have specifically organized the distribution of the tokens into nine categories, along with their respective locks plus vesting schedules.

**Public Sale: 64.50%**
The largest allocation, 64.50%, is reserved for the public sale, ensuring a sustainable token economy with the entire allocation released upon the TGE. Scheduled to take place on Coinecta's launchpad on August 5th, 2024, this sale will open up the majority of the token supply to the public.
- Lock & Vesting: Not Applicable

**Liquidity: 10.00%**
To facilitate trading and stability, 10% of the total supply will be allocated to the liquidity pool. This pool will be launched on SundaeSwap and additional DEX’s.
- Lock & Vesting: N/A

**Treasury: 10.00%**
A 10% allocation is dedicated to the treasury, governed and used for marketing and future fundraising. Therefore, the allocation would consist of PR, CEX listing, marketing hirees, and ad spend for further marketing reach. 
- Lock & Vesting: 12-month lock with 12-month vesting

**Development: 7.00%**
Investing in the continuous improvement of the project, 7% of the tokens are allocated for development. This allocation supports enhancements, new features, and the overall user experience, managed by our skilled team of engineers and designers, including future hires.
- Lock & Vesting: 12-month lock with 36-month vesting

**Audit: 1.00%**
To maintain the highest security standards, 1% of the tokens are set aside for third-party audits. Upon the token generation event on August 5th, 0.25% will be released to cover initial audit costs that have been conducted by Sundae Labs, with the remainder vested.
- Lock & Vesting: 12-month lock with 6-month vesting

**ISPO: 3.00%**
Early supporters who have delegated to our initial stake pool offering (ISPO), CRASH, will receive 3% of the token allocation as a reward for being early adopters. Unallocated tokens from this pool will revert to the treasury for future community proposals.

Airdrops, accounting for 1.50% of the tokens, are reserved for Bomber’s holders who hold a minimum of 3, Coinecta Stakers, and all partnered projects (Partners to be announced). Users applicable to the airdrop, will be receiving a portion of the airdrop which is weighted on the contribution size during the public sale.

**Points Exchange: 1.00%**

# Distribution & Vesting

Our tokenomics came from a sustainable and longevity perspective while weighing in a fair market launch. Hence, with the large public sale supply, we wanted to ensure the price reflected the protocol's health rather than having closed-door price discovery.

The total supply of the protocol token $CRASH is 100,000,000. To ensure transparency with our tokenomics, we have specifically organized the distribution of the tokens into nine categories, along with their respective locks plus vesting schedules.

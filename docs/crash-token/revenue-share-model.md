## Revenue Share Model

To incentivize user engagement and trading activity, our platform implements a streamlined revenue-sharing model, distributing generated income across three fundamental components of the protocol. The treasury, staking, and buyback. &#x20;

### Treasury

The treasury supports the platform's development, maintenance, and expansion. It's also staked to the Crashr Stake Pool to aid in decentralization and enhance the network. To maintain heightened security and trust, the treasury's funds are secured in a multi-signature wallet.

**Allocation**: **60%** of all collected fees.

### Staking

Staking rewards play a crucial role in promoting long-term engagement and stability within the ecosystem. Rewards are determined based on the [amount and duration](revenue-share-model.md#staking) of $CRASH tokens staked, with the total fees allocated for staking distributed to participants in the currency of ADA (Cardano).

**Allocation**: **20%** of all collected fees.

### Buyback

Aimed at stabilizing and boosting the $CRASH token's value, the buyback is conducted quarterly, it uses a set portion of the fees to repurchase $CRASH tokens. These tokens are then reintegrated into the treasury, earmarked for release via DAO approval or as part of community reward incentives.

**Allocation**: **20%** of all collected fees.\

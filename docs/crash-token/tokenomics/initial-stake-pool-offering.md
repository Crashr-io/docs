# Initial Stake Pool Offering

## **What is an Initial Stake Pool Offering (ISPO)?**

An Initial Stake Pool Offering (ISPO) is an innovative fundraising mechanism utilized within the Cardano Ecosystem. It presents a unique approach, diverging from traditional Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), by leveraging the Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus model. ISPOs encourage active participation and a sense of community.&#x20;

## Crashr ISPO

CRASH is a cutting-edge platform that harnesses the power of the Cardano Blockchain. Unlike other blockchain technologies, Cardano distinguishes itself with its unique functionalities and features. This makes it an ideal choice for our platform, allowing us to leverage its robust and innovative ecosystem for our Initial Stake Pool Offering (ISPO). This ISPO is a cornerstone of our strategy, enabling us to tap into the strengths of Cardano's Proof of Stake (PoS) system, and aligning perfectly with our commitment to innovation and community engagement.

## Rewards Calculator

CRASHR employs a straightforward and equitable reward system, designed for clarity and fairness for all participants. Those who delegate to our stake pool early will optimize their CRASH token rewards.

&#x20;In addition to the standard ISPO rewards, our delegators have the opportunity to earn extra through our Bonus Reward Program which is based on _Amount of Epochs_ and _NFT holdings_.&#x20;

When you delegate to our stake pool, Epochs don't have to be consecutive. ONLY the total number of epochs matter.

## Partner SPOs

![SPO Partners](/img/partner spo.png)

Stake Pool Operator (SPO) partnership with four pools — [RUMOR](https://twitter.com/MladenLm), [KTOP](https://twitter.com/KTOP\_Pool), [HAPPY](https://twitter.com/happystaking), and [ELEMENTAL](https://twitter.com/ElementalPool) — as part of our CRASHR Initial Stake Pool Offering (ISPO).

### **Our Partnership**

We have structured our partnership so that 10% of the rewards accrued in the main pool: [**CRASH**](https://www.gomaestro.org/marketplace/37), for each epoch, commencing with Epoch 459, will be uniformly distributed among our four partner stake pools as part of our ISPO allocation. This equitable distribution strategy is meticulously designed to ensure that every partner pool derives equal benefit from their contributions to CRASHR’s ecosystem.

The Partnership is rooted in the fundamental belief of strengthening the Cardano ecosystem through collaboration and mutual support. By partnering with SPOs, we are not only expanding the reach and impact of the CRASH token but also fostering a more interconnected and robust community. This collaborative effort with SPOs ensures that the benefits of our growth are shared, contributing to a more decentralized and equitable blockchain environment. It’s a step towards nurturing a vibrant, and engaged community.

### **SPO Allocation**

To simplify, 10% of the CRASH generated in the main pool will be allocated for distribution among all delegators within our partnered pools. The individual share for each delegator is determined by the proportion of their ADA stake in comparison to the cumulative ADA staked across all four of our partnered pools. This straightforward method ensures a fair and equitable distribution of rewards, reflecting our commitment to balanced and transparent practices.

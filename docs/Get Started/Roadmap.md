# Roadmap

We want to ensure that Crashr is adaptable and flexible to changes in blockchain technology and various future use cases of NFTs, FTs, and RWAs. Below is our three-phase plan to prepare for mass adoption and to bring more market share to the Cardano ecosystem from other chains.

**Phase 1**: Establish, and launch
* **Smart Contract Auditing:** Currently in progress with Sundae Labs, we want to ensure all of our smart contracts are secure, reliable, and as efficent as possible.
* **Beta Release:** Launch our beta on mainnet to gather as much user feedback from our holders, and other participants whom have been invited.
* **Official Mainnet Launch:** After gathering all feedback and completing the smart contract auditing, Crashr will be official, and all users can begin a new form of trading.
* **$CRASH Token:** Launch the Crashr's governance token that will also aid in gamification of the platform.
* **DAO Governance:** Curate a DAO proposal system to allow community partcipation in various decision making processes. 
* **In-House Data APIs:** Give other projects, or developers who need to utilize our advanced API systems for data on our platform. _(Please inquire if interested in learning more)_

**Phase 2**: Evolve and Grow
* **Mass Update:** Implement various features to enhance the dynamics of Crashr. These features include advanced trading analytics, messaging, and much more. 
* **Marketplace Aggregation:** Integrate multiple marketplaces to provide users with a unified trading experience and up-to-date data.
* **Multichain Implementations:** Start integrating support for multiple blockchains to expand our interoperability.
* **Real World Asset Section for Trades:** Introduce a section dedicated to trading real-world assets on the platform, including tokenizing real-world assets and enabling trading between users.
* **CIP-68 Identity/Profile Tokens:** Mintable CIP-68 Identity/Profile Tokens, with each profile holding all trade history and user actions. 
* **SDKs:** Embeddable SDKs to enable integration with third-party applications and services. This includes dApps, and other project pages to utilize.

**Phase 3:** Dominate
* **Blockchain Gaming Partnerships (P2P Trading):** Form partnerships with blockchain games to enable peer-to-peer trading of in-game assets.
* **Web 2 Gaming Integrations (CS2, Dota, TF2, etc.):** Integrate with popular Web 2 games to bridge the gap between traditional and blockchain gaming.
* **Crashr Premium:** Introduce a premium subscription with new features and advanced analytics for power users.

_We will continue making adjustments and additions while we progress through these phases. Simultaneously, we will push out ongoing platform updates, new features, and additional audits._

# Roadmap

Last Updated 10/06/2024

We want to ensure that Crashr is adaptable and flexible to changes in blockchain technology and various future use cases of NFTs, FTs, and RWAs. Below is our four-phase plan to prepare for mass adoption and to bring more market share to the Cardano ecosystem from other chains. Below will be a brief overview of what we have completed, what is in progress, and what is to come.

First, Crashrâ€™s Development team has worked and completed the following to ensure a successful beta launch on mainnet, which completes our Phase 1, to establish and launch the working product.

Regarding the Protocol Beta, below are the two phases we will focus on and complete until we have an official protocol launch and shift out of beta. As a reminder, our reward mechanism is live on the backend, listed in Beta Rewards. Each trade can earn $CRASH and partner project assets as well.

## Phase 1: Establish and Launch - Completed

- Crashr Protocol Beta Features deployed
  - Full functionality of our smart contracts
  - Migrate testnet into mainnet
  - Full off-chain data architecture via Crashr Sync
  - Trade dialogue for NFTs, FTs, and ADA for anything
  - On-chain notifications
  - Updated token and NFT pricing
  - Backup & Monitoring system
  - Updated Chain Compatibility
  - Metamask integration
  - Organized on-chain verified assets
  - Token/NFT Verification form
  - Enhanced search Infrastructure
  - Smart Contract Audit
  - Continuous minor bug fixes and implementations

## Phase 2: Perfection, Speed, and Growth - Completed

- Crashr Beta Features Coming Soon
  - **JPG Price Indexing and Aggregation**: By aggregating JpgStore's Smart Contract, you can build transactions straight on Crashr, and trade any token for anything listed on JpgStore, providing no limitations for the buyer or seller.
  - **Updated Landing Page and Dynamic Roadmap Page**: We are redesigning our current waitlist page and added an easily accessible roadmap section for all users to see what has been completed and what is the current pending focus.
  - **Trading View Integration**: Per token pages, seamless integration with the trading view chart to keep track of your favorite tokens in one place.
  - **Leaderboard**: This is a way for users to track their standings with beta rewards and incentives they will be receiving for trading on Crashr.

After completing these core fundamentals, we will spin out of the beta phase and begin delivering our utility and ecosystem benefits for Q4 2024.

## Phase 3: Ecosystem Focus - Begins Q4 2024

- **API/SDK Integration**: Have our Crashr Sync APIs and Trading SDKs become easily integrated for other projects to scale the amount of assets throughout our protocol.
- **Crashr Treasury Page**: To keep everything simple and transparent, our community treasury will be easily accessible on our website, where the metrics of the ADA fees, token fees, and community NFTs that are up for giveaway will be.
- **DAO Proposal System**: Allow community participation in various decision-making processes. The DAO will focus on Community/Partnerships, Treasury investments, and Development.
- **$CRASH Staking**: Under our revenue split model, a portion of fees, including ADA and other project tokens traded on the protocol, will be utilized in the staking. Once the treasury pool grows, the staking feature will be live with the respective APYs and duration.

## Phase 4: Real-world Bridge - 2025

- **Multichain Implementations**: Trade anything for anything, now on any chain. The goal is to make trading seamless regardless of the chain. EVM native L2s will be the first focus, after which we will branch off to other notable chains.
- **Real-World Asset Facilitation**: Introduce a section dedicated to trading real-world assets on the platform, including tokenizing them and enabling user trading. This will include a partnership with another unnamed project that tokenizes real-world items.
- **Web 2 Gaming Integrations (CS2, Dota, TF2, etc.)**: Integrate with popular Web 2 games to bridge the gap between traditional and blockchain gaming. This will make all assets tradable and bring liquidity to the Cardano Ecosystem.

# Roadmap

For the roadmap and future initiatives of the Crashr Protocol, we recognize there is more room for growth and improvements. To explore more opportunities in the Crashr ecosystem, some of the plans include:

* **SDKs:** Developing API SDKs and Embeddable SDKs to enable seamless integration with third-party applications and services.
* **CIP-68 Identity/Profile Tokens:** Exploring the implementation of CIP-68 Identity/Profile Tokens to enhance profile management within the marketplace.
* **Marketplace Aggregator:** Building a marketplace aggregator to provide users with a comprehensive view of all available listings and offers across multiple platforms.
* **Staking Platform:** We’d like to integrate staking capabilities into the platform to enable users to earn rewards by staking their assets.
* **Cross-chain Compatibility:** Exploring interoperability with other blockchains to enable multi-chain asset trading. This includes cross-chain trading, bridging assets, and more.
* **Real-World Asset Trading:** We’re also exploring tokenizing real-world assets and enabling their trading on the Crashr platform.

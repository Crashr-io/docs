## Step 3: Choose Your Trading Mode
Crashr offers two modes:
- **Basic Mode:** By default, this is selected. It allows you to list your asset for a specific native token, including stablecoins.
- **Advanced Mode:** This mode lets you list your asset for multiple native tokens, stablecoins, collections, and even specific NFTs.

Once you’ve chosen your mode, click the “+” icon to add the asset you want to list. You can list multiple assets and filter between your NFTs and tokens using the filter above the search bar.

### If using Basic Mode
Click the dropdown menu to select the token you want in exchange. By default, it’s set to ADA, but you can choose any verified native token on the Cardano blockchain. Enter the amount of tokens you’d like to receive, and after clicking “Submit,” you’ll be prompted to review your listing.

### Step 4.5: For Advanced Mode Users
If you’ve added your items, you can now choose what you’d like in return. Options include specific NFTs, assets from a collection (Collection Offer), or a particular amount of tokens. The possibilities are vast, as you can select from any of the available categories.

If you choose to request assets from a collection or a specific token, you’ll be able to move to the next step after entering the quantity. For collections, input the number of assets you’re requesting from that collection. For tokens, specify the amount you’d like by clicking on the desired token and entering the quantity.

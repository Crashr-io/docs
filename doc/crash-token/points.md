# Points

## **Acquisition of Points**

Points are awarded to both the buyer and seller of a transaction, equivalent in value to the ADA involved. For example: If your transaction is worth 100 ADA, you and the other party receive 100 Points that are linked to the connected wallet.

## Points System Dynamics

Instead of directly awarding $CRASH tokens for every transaction, Crashr introduces a points system. This approach is developed to prevent the rapid dispersion of tokens, which could lead to devaluation due to oversupply.&#x20;

Hereâ€™s how it benefits the ecosystem:

* **Mitigating Volatility:** By awarding points for transactions instead of tokens, we minimize the risk of token over saturation. This careful control helps maintain the token's value and ensures a stable trading environment.
* **Flexible Rewards:** Users accumulate points through their activity on Crashr. These points are not just placeholders; they're a versatile currency within our platform. With them, users can claim $CRASH tokens according to a set vesting schedule, aligning with our gradual release strategy to further stabilize the token economy.

### Points for NFTs

The utility of points extends beyond token claims. Recognizing the diverse interests of our users, points can also be transferred towards acquiring Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) within the Crashr ecosystem.&#x20;

## Current Points v1.0

Points are currently awarded to users for staking our NFT collection and to early testers of Crashr v1.0. Upon the Token Generation Event (TGE), these users will receive an airdrop of $CRASH Tokens, determined by the number of points they have at that time. With the introduction of the new points dynamic, staking will be phased out, making trading the sole way to earn points on our platform. Until this new system is in place, users can gain points by both staking and trading on v1.0.

## Conclusion

Our points system is at the heart of Crashr's commitment to creating a sustainable, user-centric trading platform. By innovating beyond traditional token rewards, we offer a balanced approach that rewards user activity while maintaining the integrity and value of the ecosystem.&#x20;
